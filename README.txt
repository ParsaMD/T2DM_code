## Instructions for Running the Code

1. Unzip all files into a single folder on your computer.
2. Make sure `code.ipynb`, `mock_internal.csv`, `mock_FINDRISC.csv`, etc are all in the same folder.
3. Open `code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Ensure you have the required Python packages: pandas, numpy, etc.
5. Run all cells. The code will automatically find the CSV files.
